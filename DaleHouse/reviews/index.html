								<p>Well located with three pubs on your doorstep and nice tea room next door. Plenty of walking routes. Property has mixture of en-suites and bed layouts but plenty for large groups or families. Two fridges in the kitchen and a large fridge/freezer in the boot room provided ample space for food/beers/wine. Owners answered any questions quickly and would recommend to other large families/groups</p>

								<p>I booked the house for my 60th Birthday / retirement celebration with a large group of friends. It was ideal and a great location for our group who are keen walkers / cyclists, especially as the Tour De Yorkshire happened to be going past too!

The house was comfortable, very well equipped for catering for a large group and the number of bedrooms and bathrooms gave us lots of space. Kettlewell is a really pretty village with lots of walks available and nearby pubs so a great base.

We would happily return.</p>

								<p>Dale House offered versatile accommodation, with 9 bedrooms and with several ensuites and house bathrooms. It's a good location for a walking holiday in the Dales. There are easy riverside and village walks straight from the house for those not fit for the fells.

The kitchen was very well equipped - we easily managed large-scale dinners. There is room in the spacious dining room to seat everyone. But if you couldn't be bothered cooking there are three pubs in the village and you can do some scenic walks to some very good pubs that do food up the Dale.</p>

								<p>Cannot thank you enough for the ease of hiring Dale House for our 25th Wedding Anniversary. The house was 
								perfect in every way, our guests were delighted, rooms and facilities all of a high standard. Well equipped 
								kitchen and plenty of fridge space meant that whatever self catering we wanted was not just possible but a 
								pleasure. Then when our guests saw the village and surrounding countryside they understood why I had chosen this venue!.</p>
